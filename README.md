# School Management System (SMS)

A lightweight **School Management System (SMS)** built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and a small amount of **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project demonstrates how core school administration workflows can be handled on the client side using modern frontend techniques.

The system allows managing students, teachers, subjects, and assigning teachers and subjects to classes in an organized and user-friendly way.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Users can add students, teachers, and subjects using popup forms.
2. Data is stored in **browser LocalStorage**, ensuring persistence after refresh.
3. Each class can be assigned:
   - One or more subjects
   - Corresponding teachers
4. Edit and delete operations dynamically update the UI and LocalStorage.
5. Event delegation is used for efficient DOM handling.
